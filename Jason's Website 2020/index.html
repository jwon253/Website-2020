                <p> Welcome <a class="links" href="http://www.ormiston.school.nz/">Ormiston Senior College</a>. Mechanical Engineering is about applying principles and problem-solving techniques from designing to manufacturing to the market place. Mechanical engineers analyze their work by using the principles of motion. They investigate problems and faults with machinery, to find improvements in manufacturing and energy production.</p>

                <h3><span class="underline">What would I Do?</span></h3> 
                    <p> Mechanical engineering uses many different skills such as creativity, knowledge and analytical tools, to achieve or overcome difficult tasks. They range on plenty of different tasks such as carry out investigations of existing systems, prepare reports based on findings, prepare plans and drawings of machines or machine parts, research the use of energy sources, machinery and materials, review to test new systems and many more related tasks.</p>

                <h3><span class="underline">What would I earn?</span></h3>
                    <p>Graduate mechanical with one year of experience can potentially earn around $50,000 to 56,000 a year. 
                    Mechanical engineers with two to five years of experience can potentially earn around $57,000 to 77,000 a year. 
                    Experienced mechanical engineers working in a role such as a team leader or technical manager can earn around $110,000 to $180,000 a year.</p>
